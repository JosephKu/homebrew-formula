# Homebrew-formula

My Homebrew formulae.


## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap josephku/formula` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from other taps, you can:

```
brew install josephku/formula/<formula>
```

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/JosephKu/homebrew-formula/master/<formula>.rb
```
